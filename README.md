## 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
Bubbling Up

Author: Felix Vidal

### Project Overview

"Bubbling Up" is an interactive animation project inspired by classic screensavers and games. Originally conceived as a snake-like animation, it evolved into a dynamic visual experience featuring bubbles that appear, expand, and pop on the screen. This README provides a detailed account of the design journey, influences, and technical instructions for running the project.

### Design Intentions

Initially inspired by the classic game Snake, the project's goal was to create an interactive scene where the screen fills with lines resembling snakes. However, the design evolved, leading to the concept of bubbles that gradually pop on the screen.

External Influences and Inspirations
3D Pipes Screensaver: The dynamic movement and depth perception of the classic 3D pipes screensaver was the original inspiration.

The Incredibles' Black Orbs Scene: The expanding black circles from "The Incredibles" inspired the bubble concept.

Bubbles Imagery: The final design was inspired by the appearance and behavior of bubbles.

### Design Journal

- Part 1: Exploration and Inspiration
Concept: A snake-like animation filling the screen.
Inspiration: Classic games and screensavers, particularly the 3D pipes screensaver.

- Part 2: Iteration and Realization
Initial Attempts: Creating a grid on the canvas with a traversing line simulating snake motion.
Reassessment: Constraints led to exploring alternative concepts while maintaining dynamic animation.

- Part 3: Experimentation and Refinement
New Avenues: Experimented with expanding circles resembling explosions.
Challenges: Complexity led to a chaotic visual experience.
Refinement: Developed a grid of circles, using noise functions for controlled expansion and contraction.

- Part 4: Evolution and Finalization
Simplified Design: Black background with white circles, adding a rainbow ring for chromatic aberration.
Final Modifications: Simulated bubble popping based on animation progression, added randomization for visual interest.

### Running the Project

To view the project, follow these steps:

- Open in Visual Studio Code:

  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

- Run the Project:

  - Navigate to the index.html file.
  - Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server" (if you have the Live Server extension installed) or open it directly in your browser.
  - The project should open in a new browser tab, displaying the interactive animation.
